\t\t\t\t\t\t\tüî§ Welcome to the Vocabulary Adventurous Game!

In this game, you'll embark on an exciting journey to expand your vocabulary by guessing words based on given clues.

Here's how to play:

1. Objective:

Your goal is to correctly guess the word that corresponds to the clue provided at each level.

2. Levels:

The game is divided into four distinct levels, each increasing in difficulty:

a. Easy: Clues are straightforward, and the words are common. This level is designed to warm you up.
b. Intermediate: Clues become a bit more challenging, requiring you to think a little deeper.
c. Professional: Expect more complex clues and less common words. This level is for players with a strong vocabulary.
d. Hard: The ultimate test! Clues are cryptic, and the words are rare or have multiple layers of meaning.

3. Gameplay Mechanics:

Clue Presentation: At the start of each level, you'll be given a clue related to a specific word.
Unlimited Attempts: You have unlimited tries to guess the correct word for each level. Don‚Äôt worry about making mistakes‚Äîtake your time to think it through!
Advancing Levels: Once you successfully guess the word at your current level, you automatically progress to the next level.
Feedback: After each guess, you will receive immediate feedback. If your guess is incorrect, keep trying until you find the right word.
Lifelines: At the first level, you will start with only one lifeline. As you clear each level, your lifelines will increase, giving you additional support as you continue your journey.
Note: Tenses also matters
Note: Give more importance to the single quoted word in the clue.

4. Streaks:
This variable keeps track of the number of consecutive times you have successfully completed the entire game.
Each time you complete the final level (i.e., after the Hard level), your streak count increases by 1.
If you give up during any level (by pressing '2'), your streak resets to 0.
Keep pushing your limits and try to beat your high streak!
5. Tips for Success:

Think about the clue carefully and consider multiple meanings or associations.
Use your vocabulary knowledge and intuition to deduce the correct word.
Don't be afraid to use your lifelines when you need a little extra help.
Stay positive and have fun! This game is designed to challenge
you and help you learn new words along the way.
Enjoy the process of learning new words and challenging yourself as the game progresses.
